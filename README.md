# 👋 Hi, I'm Yan Matos  

I am passionate about **technology, programming, and logical challenges**.  
I am currently a **student at 42 Porto**, where I am diving deep into programming, algorithms, and teamwork. 🚀

## 🧑‍💻 A bit about me  

-  Always looking to learn new things and improve my skills  
-  Participated in the **42 Boot Camp (Piscine)**, which gave me a solid foundation and sparked even more interest in programming 
-  I enjoy training and believe in a balance between mind and body  
- I like sharing knowledge and exchanging ideas with other devs
